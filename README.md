# Weekend React Gallery
***4-Day Project***

## Description

I sure miss getting attention like I used to in the before times. Luckily for me, you're looking at my code. Pretty soon you'll be looking at my photo descriptions and then you'll be looking at my photos. You can love them if you want but even if you think they're terrible there's no way to display your displeasure. It's a pretty airtight situation as far as creative outlets are concerned.
